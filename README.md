Project: PokedexP

My first step in creating the prototype was to make it match the mockup as closely as possible. Starting with the header with the text Pokemon Generator. My mockup had two different colors for the title, one yellow, one blue, and I wasn't really sure how to achieve it with the custom font I downloaded, so I just left the color black to match the rest of the pokedex. I continued to stylize the header part by adding some padding and margin. Next, I created all the cards for the pokemon that would appear on the screen. There were 10 pokemon listed in the pokemon list section and 10 pokemon caught. Because I didn't use Java script, I used placeholder numbers. When making the cards, I used a grid to create them and organized them using w3 schools as a guide. The button is also on the page, but does nothing at the moment since I do not have Javascript in the site as of yet. The extra information about each Pokemon was not filled in due to no Javascript, so the pokemons' weight and typing could not be shown without it. The caught list section was updated in the same way. 10 cards and placeholders until Javascript is used. Once all that was done I made the site functional for mobile devices with media queries and repeated the same steps. My next steps in this case are to actually add the pokemon and make the button generate more than 20 pokemon this time and to add pokemon to the caught list.
