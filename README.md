Since all the other work like the html and css was mostly done I started working on the javscript. My first step was to load the 20 default pokemon on the page and make sure they would stay if they would refresh the page. After I would make the button at the bottom function by loading 20 more pokemon by calling on the API. It was definetly tough but I managed by using sites like w3school and Mozilla developer sites. After that I would start by making the pokemon clickable and make a modal with a larger image and information. Luckily I was used to it since I used my interactive Gallery as a way of guiding me through the process. My Main issue that i struggled with was having the pokemon saved to the local storage. I kept getting errors in my console and nothing would save even if were to refresh the page. After going through that I made sure that the pokemon were removable from the caught list. Overall, I feel like the process could have been easier if I had a more simple design and had a plan when designing it.
