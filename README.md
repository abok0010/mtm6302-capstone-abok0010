Report about the mockup

The mockup was designed based on the description of the PokeAPI. As soon as the user loads the page, 20 pokemon cards will be displayed. If the user would like to generate more then 20 pokemon they can do so by pressing the button under the list of pokemon and it would generate even more pokemon. A user can learn more about a pokemon by clicking on its image. This will take them to another page describing the pokemon and whether they've ever caught or released it. Every page has a Caught section where pokemon that have been caught are displayed. All Pokemon caught would be separated from those on the Pokemon list. This mockup uses red color to match the Pokemon theme, while Segoue Ui fonts are used on the page. To match an actual pokedex, I chose a simple font since they use simple fonts to display the information. Additionally, the logo used on the page is Pokemon themed to keep the branding consistent. Compared to the desktop mockups, the only major difference is that the information and boxes are properly resized and displayed for mobile devices.The process would be the same regardless of the device you are on.
